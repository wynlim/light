## Rethinking mental illnesses 

* "The results of our study found that depressed people were accurate when estimating time whereas non-depressed peoples' estimations were too high. This may be because mildly-depressed people focus their attention on time and less on external influences, and therefore have clarity of thought -- a phenomenon known as 'depressive realism'." – [Depressed people have a more accurate perception of time](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130822090326.htm)
* “The researchers found that the depressed individuals were much better at identifying those instances when they had little control over the outcomes, while the non-depressed students tended to overestimate their degree of influence over the light.” – [The New Yorker: Don’t Worry, Be Happy](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/dont-worry-be-happy)
* "Laboratory experiments indicate that depressed people are better at solving social dilemmas by better analysis of the costs and benefits of the different options that they might take." – [Scientific American: Depression's Evolutionary Roots](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/depressions-evolutionary/)
* "A leading neuroscientist who has spent decades studying creativity shares her research on where genius comes from, whether it is dependent on high IQ—and why it is so often accompanied by mental illness." – [The Atlantic: Secrets of the Creative Brain](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/06/secrets-of-the-creative-brain/372299/)
* "Creative ideas probably occur as part of a potentially dangerous mental process, when associations in the brain are flying freely during unconscious mental states — how thoughts must become momentarily disorganized prior to organizing. Such a process is very similar to that which occurs during psychotic states of mania, depression, or schizophrenia." – [Brainpickings: The Relationship Between Creativity and Mental Illness](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/07/21/creativity-and-mental-illness/)
* "Because gifted children are able to consider the possibilities of how things might be, they tend to be idealists. However, they are simultaneously able to see that the world is falling short of how it might be. Because they are intense, gifted children feel keenly the disappointment and frustration which occurs when ideals are not reached" – [Existential Depression in Gifted Children](http://theunboundedspirit.com/existential-depression-in-gifted-children/)
